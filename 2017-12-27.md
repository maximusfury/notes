# 1: Language Keywords Learned (The Purple Ones)
- `var`
 - you can assign a new value after Declaration
- `let`
 - once you assign a value to it you can't assign another value to it

````
// a constant declaration with 'let'

let constant = 5.0/2

// ERROR: Cannot assign to value: 'constant' is a 'let' constant
constant = 2
//a variable declaration with 'var'

var remainder = 3%4

# 2: Types Learned (The Blue Ones)

## Numbers

1. `Int`
  - You can't make decimals from them.
1. `Float`
 - can allow for decimals
1. `Double`
 - allow for bigger maximum number without crashing

_**(go over board and the system will crash!!!)**_

_**(types are always capitalized.)**_

_**(maximum number for the `Int` type is `Int.max = 9223372036854775807`) **_
##  Words

1. `Character`
  - A single representation of a letter.

2. `String`
  - A chain of Characters

# 3: operators

- equal `=`
 - equal is used for assignment

 ````
 var intmax = Int.max
 let halfmax = intmax/2

 ````
- modulo `%`
 - modulo shows the remainder of the problem
````
var remainder = 3%4 // 3
````

- multiply `*`

- addition+`+`

- subtraction `-`

````
var intmax = Int.max
let halfmax = intmax/2


var newdouble = 2.0

// ERROR: Binary operator '*' cannot be applied to operands of type 'Double' and 'Int'
let newmax = newdouble*halfmax


````

_**operators must work on the same type**_

`let other = letter + " " + letter2`

# 4: Concepts

## Variable Declaration

- `var` vs `let`
 - always choose `let` over `var`

- Type Inference
 - when the computer guess your type of the variable
 - you can disable type inference by adding a colon `:` after the variables name and the specific type

 ````
 var string1 = "a"

 let character6: Character = "a"

 ````
  _**(`highlighted` words are code)**_
